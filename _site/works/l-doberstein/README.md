*Abstract*:  
This exposé for a master thesis, challenges the current state of web accessibility in development and studies best practices during the development process as well as testing options for accessibility. The thesis aims to make parts of the web more accessible and reveal accessibility best practices for development particularly when developing from scratch.

By leveraging the existing guidelines and practices around accessibility as well as
testing methods and development frameworks this study will bring forth comprehensive knowledge on accessibility best practices for the early stages of the delivery process. Within a practical study, literature will be reviewed, best practices will be identified, a landingpage will be migrated and the data will be analysed. That specific landingpage is a product of SoSafe, a company operating in the field of
cyber security. Their security training includes a landingpage which will in this study be migrated to a framework and therefore be the product used to evaluate accessibility best practices.

In conclusion, this work contributes to the field of accessibility by evaluating best
practices for developers and making one part of SoSafe’s products more accessible. Aiming to make the web more inclusive, piece by piece.
