# **State-of-the-Art approach to working with sounds on the web**

## Problem

In the last 10-15 years, the frontend has made a big leap in development and continues to develop at a rapid pace. The modern frontend has extensive functionality that allows to create fairly complex web applications using native technologies that are supported by all major browsers. The above is also relevant for working with sound. The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more. At the same time, this technology is poorly covered in the technical literature, and many modern developer guides are limited to mentioning the audio tag.

## Goals

This master's work sets the following goals.

- Give a brief overview of the history of working with audio on the web.
- Explore in detail capabilities of the Web Audio API and prepare an example of its use.
- Try to describe how the Web audio API will change in the future

At the beginning, it will be explore how the working with sound in the web has changed up to the present. Topics such as the use of special tags and Flash will be mentioned. Particular attention will be paid to the disadvantages of such approaches to working with sound.

Next, a modern approach to working with sound, which is based on the HTML5 standard, will be studied in detail. In addition, a real example of using the modern audio API will be prepared.

At the end, an attempt will be made to find out how working with sound will change in the near future. To do this, proposals and current bugs in the Web API will be studied.

## Time schedule

Based on the above, the following milestones can be distinguished:

- Collection and analysis of information about working with sound
- Studying approaches to work with sound used in the past and present
- Building a web application that demonstrates the modern capabilities of the Web Audio API
- Exploring how working with sound might change in the future
- Documentation of results
- Preparing an application code repository and deploying the application

Duration: 16 - 24 weeks
